## Workshop for Generative AI in public sector.

Generative AI has transformed the way AI can augment human capabilities. Large Language Models (LLM) and Stable Diffusion is changing the way we work, finishing tasks in minutes, that earlier took hours or days. In this workhop we will see a few use cases of how Generative AI can be used in public sector, specifically in education, healthcare and Geospatial.

The workshop has four labs.

### 1. Large Language Models for Education
The first module walks you through the process of deploying a Large Language Model in AWS using SageMaker Jumpstart. It then covers multiple use cases in education. For example it shows you how to generate QnA pair from a piece of text, or how to summarize a large text and so on.

### 2. Fine tuning an LLM on Medical data
In the second module, we see how to fine-tune an LLM on medical question and answer pairs. 

### 3. CTScan Upscaler
In the third module, we see how to upscale a CTScan image using Stable diffusion.

### 4. Synthetic Satellite
In the fourth module, we see how fine-tuning stable diffusion using satellite images improves the quality of satellite image generation. We use Dreambooth to fine tune stable diffusion.
